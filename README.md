# Foundations of HPC - Project

### Davide Rossi - Sara Candussio

This GitHub repository contains the execution of the assignment proposed for the course **Foundations of High Performance Computing** from the Data Science and Scientific Computing course of University of Trieste. Inside the repository you can find:
  
  - a folder `exercise1` which contains the execution of the first proposed exercise: implement a parallelized version of the Game of Life by Conway, using MPI and OpenMP to spread the workload between different processes and threads;
  
  - a folder `exercise2` which contains the execution of the second proposed exercise: compare performances of OpenBLAS and MKL libraries on matrix-matrix multiplication, studying scalability over the size of the matrix (at fixed number of cores) and over the number of cores (at fixed size of the matrix);

  - a file `Report.pdf` that sums up the achieved results and the methods used to reach them.
